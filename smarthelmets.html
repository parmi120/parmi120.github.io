        <p>The nfl is most definetly one of the most dangerous sports, due to the amount of head on collisons, so the amount of technology needs to be increased for the nfl due to the danger. Research shows that 60 percent of football collisions are head-to-head, with 37 percent of helmet-to-helmet impacts occurring in the front, 36 percent in the back, and the remainder on the sides from a rotational force. Professional players will take an average of 900 to 1,500 blows to the head during a season. Technology such as smart helmets are in place to take action against the amount of head injuries but nothing is for sure yet.
            <br>
            <br>To further assist the independent certified athletic trainers (ATC Spotters) at the Pro Bowl and protect players from potential injuries, the NFL will provide an additional independent injury review system on each sideline. Currently, one system is shared by both the home and away independent spotters. The new system allows each spotter to focus on one team rather than all players and will increase the possibility that a potential injury will be identified. The league will also test: Improvements to further advance the function of the coach-to-coach (C2C) and coach-to-player (C2P) communications systems,
            <br>Upgraded belts for coaches wearing communications systems A new web-based Game Statistics and Information System, which captures play-by-play game data during NFL games that is used by media, the NFL and its clubs, and are published on NFL.com.
            <br>
            <br> Most recently technology such as virtual reality has been used to train the players, this can be useful as you are able to mimic real life situtations and then adapt to them without having to get physical, this could potentionally reduce the injuries.
            <br> the nfl also incorporates effective use of player tracking using RFID chips which can be accessed by all fans and most importantly by the coaches they play for, as this can provide a catalyst for analylsis.
