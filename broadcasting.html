        <p>Broadcasting of sports is so powerful, with sports such as football raking in billions for tv agreements, the power of broadcasting means that broadcasters can dictate which teams they wish to show and what days they will be playing, broadcasting has changed the way we watch sports from being able to view the sport and to be able to make a show of it by giving analysis and live updates.
            <br> There are some downsides to broadcasting such as the price of the broadcasting packages, which has lead to an influx of free to watch streams on the internet, which is obviously going to anger broadcasters the same way subscribers of the broadcast packages are angry at the price of the packages. Broadcasting is one of the many entities which has benefited from the increase of technology as we have gone from radio broadcasts to live HD and even 3D capabilities, with technology broadcasting has been further enchanced through the use of instant replays and alternative camera angle capabilities.
            <br> Transmitters are used to send the signal towards the recievers this can be achieved through cable or satellite technology, what is transmitted is audio and video and then outputted to the relevant device.


            <br>
            <br>Here are some stats to show the impact of broadcasting upon the population : <br> The 2014 FIFA World Cup drew more than 200 million viewers per game, with the championship game between Germany and Argentina drawing 913 million viewers globally.
            <br> The Cricket World Cup in 2015 had more than 1 billion viewers for the final game between India and Pakistan on Feb. 15, 2015. About 288 million of those viewers were in India. The 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup broke ratings records when the U.S. team defeated Japan 5-2 at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, Canada. Some 61 million viewers watched that final game and the tournament overall drew 750 million viewers. The 2016 Summer Olympics had 3.5 billion viewers worldwide and 198 million viewers in the U.S. </p>
